To release some pressure from the storage of our HPC Watson, we can put larger
files at an external storage past the *horizon* and retrieve them when needed.
To keep both connected, a `.verge` exchange link file is created.

By only moving large files and keeping them linked, we can save a lot of space
and still keep project structure intact.

## Installation

To install HRZN download and unpack the latest [release](https://github.com/skranz0/hrzn/releases)
and run the `install` script:

```bash
sudo bash install
```

This will copy all neccessary files to the right locations in your system.
This includes a `config` at `/etc/hrzn/config` and a `hrzn` executable in `/usr/local/bin/`.

To use HRZN systemwide, you need to add it to your PATH.

## Usage

HRZN uses mainly three subcommands (partially still in developement):

- [x] `hrzn push` to push files to the external storage
- [x] `hrzn pull` to pull files from the external storage

### The `.verge` file

When a file is pushed away with hrzn, the verge file is left behind to keep the project structure intact

It is structured like this:

```
path_o        original/path/of/file.txt
path_x        external/path/of/file.txt
checksum_o    a3cca2b2aa1e3b5b3b5aad99a8529074
checksum_x    a3cca2b2aa1e3b5b3b5aad99a8529074
